## What is YAML?

YAML is a straightforward and intuitive language designed to be easily readable by both humans and machines. It uses indentation and basic punctuation to represent data structures, making it an excellent choice for configuration files.

## Syntax

- YAML files use the `.yaml` or `.yml` file extension.
- Indentation is significant in YAML and should be done using spaces (typically 2 or 4 spaces).
- YAML uses colons (:) to separate keys from values.
- Lists are denoted using a hyphen (-) followed by a space.
- Comments can be added using the hash symbol (#).

## Data Types

YAML supports several data types, including:

- Scalars: Strings, numbers, booleans, and null.
- Sequences: Ordered lists of values.
- Mappings: Key-value pairs.

## Examples

Here are a few examples to illustrate YAML syntax:

### Scalar Example

```yaml
name: John Doe
age: 30
isStudent: false

###Sequence Example
fruits:
  - apple
  - banana
  - orange

###Mapping Example
person:
  name: Jane Smith
  address:
    street: 123 Main St
    city: Anytown
    country: USA
```
